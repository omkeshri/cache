## Overview
TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. It adds static type definitions to JavaScript, which helps developers catch errors during development rather than at runtime.

### Benefits
- Static Typing
- Code Completion
- Refactoring
- Shorthand notations


### New Data Types

- enum - multiple variables
- tuple - array size
